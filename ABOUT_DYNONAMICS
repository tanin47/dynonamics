Dynonamics
----------------------------------------------
Auto-scale your dynos (and workers coming soon)


Dynonamics is created by whowish (www.whowish.com). 
whowish is a young-tech firm, building several facebook applications, CollegeSwap, SwapSquare, Squeks, 2Meet4, and friendmage.
As a small company that hosts all of our facebook applications on Heroku, we recognize the problem of cost.
That's why we are building Dynonamics to reduce the cost of Dynos.

We are working on auto-scaling Workers also. Please look forward to it!

Here is our applications:
